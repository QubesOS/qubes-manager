Icon Notes

Most icons are taken from lucide.dev under a MIT license. They are based on
outlined icons and each icon has a stroke width which can be customized.
We recommend following stroke weight for different resolutions:

16px = 1.5px stroke
24px = 2px stroke
32px = 3px stroke
48px = 4px stroke
64px = 6px stroke

Symbolic icons are modular in color and can be adapted to different semantics
(success, warning, error for example). We recommend using neutral or gray
color schemes for the default version on light mode (e.g neutral-700).

Please note that the neutral color palette is true gray while the gray color
palette has a little tint of blue so it works better with the QubesOS brand
colors.

Some specific icons are custom based on existing lucide icons, such as the
lock-pen icon used for the policy editor.

If any further icons are needed, base them on lucide.dev icon set.
